SI 579 001 WN 2021 Problem Set 2 - Basic CSS and JavaScript

There are two separate parts to this problem set.

# Part 1: Deploying a Page with CSS
For part 1, you will practice your ability to use CSS to customize how the browser renders a page. For this, you can use the HTML page that you built for problem set 1 or you can start with a new page.

Then, you must add a stylesheet that meets all of the following requirements:

Manipulates at least 5 different CSS properties
For example, color, size, background-color, etc.
Use at least 2 different kinds of selectors
For example, selection by class, section by ID, or selection by element type.

Then, you must do at least one of the following:
* Use an external .css file
* Include a hex color code in your CSS
* Include a CSS animation (Links to an external site.)
* Include a CSS variable
* Include a media query
* You can include a media query to display different styles for responsive design (Links to an external site.)
* You can also include a media query to implement light/dark mode on your website depending on the user's preference (Links to an external site.)
* Include a Google Font (Links to an external site.)

Your submission should include the HTML page and the stylesheet.

# Part 2: Getting Started with JavaScript
Download all three JavaScript and HTML files from this directory on Canvas and add them to your files from part 1. Then, answer at least three of the four problems in the file ps2-my-code.js by filling in the functions.

You can test your code by opening ps2-tests.html in your browser.

Finally, edit your code for part 1 to somewhere add a link to ps2-tests.html:

<a href="ps2-tests.html">Part 2 Tests</a>
Include all three files (including your updated ps2-my-code.js file) along with your code from part 1 when you deploy to GitHub Pages.
